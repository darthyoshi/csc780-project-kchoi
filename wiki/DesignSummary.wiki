#summary A game for Android.

This is a curtain-fire/bullet-hell game with a current working title of "Untouchable". The game controls shall utilize the gyroscope, with the degree of tilt controlling how quickly the player's space fighter moves across the screen.

The space fighter has a charge meter that steadily fills over time. When full, the enemy mothership will be destroyed and the player will advance to the next stage. However, the player will have no other weapons, except an EMP that uses a portion of the charge meter to clear the screen of enemy fire. If the fighter is hit, the game will end.
